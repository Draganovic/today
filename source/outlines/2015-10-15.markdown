### Intro to Sequel (10:00 - 12:00)

This afternoon, we'll pull out YAML::Store from our TaskManager projects and replace it with a *real* database. In preparation for this transformation, follow [this Sequel tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/sql/sequel.html) either on your own or with a pair to learn about the Ruby library we'll use in order to interact with the database. Focus mainly on the "Abstracted SQL" section. Meet back in Classroom B at 11:30. 

You should also check out the [Sequel Github page](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) or the [Sequel documentation](http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/). 

### Task Manager Transformation with Sequel (1:00 - 4:00)

Classroom B with Rachel. You'll need [this repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/1508-task-manager) and some Tylenol.
