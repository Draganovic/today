## All

### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

Scientists have developed an allergy test that produces a single numeric score that summarizes information about all the allergies a person has.

The test checks for the following allergies and assigns them the corresponding value:

eggs (1)
peanuts (2)
shellfish (4)
strawberries (8)
tomatoes (16)
chocolate (32)
pollen (64)
cats (128)
If Jorge is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

You're job is to write a program that takes the number and translates it back the allergens that the patient is allergic to.

In this case, 34 would translate back into a report saying that Jorge was allergic to peanuts and chocolate.

Because you all love TDD, here are some cases that you can test against:

A score of two would mean that the patient is allergic to just peanuts.

A score of 3 would mean that the patient is allergic to eggs and peanuts.

## 1508

### All - Introducing Arrays (9:00 - 10:30)

Classroom A with Jeff.

### All - Introducing Hashes (10:30 - 12:00)

Classroom A. With Jeff again.

### Echo - How Testing Works (1:00 - 2:30)

Join Josh Cheek at the front of Classoom A.

We'll be working in this repository: [https://github.com/JoshCheek/how-to-test](https://github.com/JoshCheek/how-to-test).

Make sure you know how to run programs in the shell, and have the keybindings
[https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/3de9c9729481c59bcebc6f30b4f10ea52ed5d36c/shell.md#keybindings](https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/3de9c9729481c59bcebc6f30b4f10ea52ed5d36c/shell.md#keybindings).
I'm going to make you show the person adjacent to you before we go onto this stuff
(the last time I gave this lesson, it took 8 minutes to edit a file, I don't want to lose that kind of time anymore).
If you're not confident you can do those things, take 10 min during your lunch and refresh yourself.

### Echo - Sorting Suite Kickoff (2:30 - 3:00)

Stay at the front of Classroom A for sorting algorithms, y'all [https://vimeo.com/channels/sortalgorithms](https://vimeo.com/channels/sortalgorithms).

### Echo - Intro to TDD Tutorial (3:00 - 4:00)

Big Surprise, you are in the front of Classroom A.

Work independently on [this Intro to TDD tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/testing/intro-to-tdd.html).
We'll make a few changes, such as using [mrspec](https://rubygems.org/gems/mrspec)
to run our tests, but other than that, follow along, as described.

### Echo - Homework

On Monday, I told you that you need to get over yourselves.
Write 1 sentence or more identifying an area that you would benefit from applying these ideas to:

* **get over your fear**, so you don't spend years avoiding a skill you could have learned in a week.
  Have you ever just sat and enjoyed failure? Honest question.
  No amount of success has ever empowered me as much as realizing I could fail and be completely okay.
* **get over your condescension** so you don't prevent people from feeling safe enough to try their hardest
  [Bonus quote from Jane Goodall!](http://www.infinitelooper.com/?v=vibssrQKm60#/581;611).
* **get over your predispositions** so you don't flounder and possibly repeat or drop out.
  The most compelling things about programming were the new ways I learned to think.
  In fact, it's suspect to say that I even did think before programming.

Make sure you've watched this 2 minute video to see what it looks like when I navigate in the shell.

Practice until you can do each of these katas in under 20 seconds:

* [https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/3de9c9729481c59bcebc6f30b4f10ea52ed5d36c/shell.md#kata-2](https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/3de9c9729481c59bcebc6f30b4f10ea52ed5d36c/shell.md#kata-2)
* [https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/3de9c9729481c59bcebc6f30b4f10ea52ed5d36c/shell.md#kata-3](https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/3de9c9729481c59bcebc6f30b4f10ea52ed5d36c/shell.md#kata-3)

As soon as you sit down tomorrow, explain to each of the students adjacent to you what these directories mean: `/`, `~`, `.`, `..`,
the entire description should be less than 2 sentences. If someone adjacent to you explains them to you,
then listen attentively. If you believe they understand, give them a warm smile.
If you are unsure, ask a question to verify, and if they allay your concerns, give them a warm smile.
If they still seem confused, explain to them what these directories mean, have them repeat it back to you, ask another question to verify they understand,
and give them a warm smile.
