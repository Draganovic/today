### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

To covert nearly any number into a palindromic number you operate by reversing the digits and 
adding and then repeating the steps until you get a palindromic number. Some require many steps.

e.g. 24 gets palindromic after 1 steps: 66 -> 24 + 42 = 66

while 28 gets palindromic after 2 steps: 121 -> 28 + 82 = 110, so 110 + 11 (110 reversed) = 121.

Note that, as an example, 196 never gets palindromic (at least according to researchers, at least never in 
reasonable time). Several numbers never appear to approach being palindromic.

Input Description

You will be given a number, one per line. Example:

11

68

Output Description

You will describe how many steps it took to get it to be palindromic, and what the resulting palindrome is. 

Example:

11 gets palindromic after 0 steps: 11

68 gets palindromic after 3 steps: 1111
