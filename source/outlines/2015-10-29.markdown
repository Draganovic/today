### Getting Started with Express (9:00 - 12:00)

We've been playing a bit with Node over the last few weeks. [Express][] is a popular web framework for Node. We'll be using it a bit more later on in the module. Your mission this morning is to get comfortable with it.

1. Start by working through the [ExpressWorks][ew] NodeSchool workshop.
2. Can you build a small version of IdeaBox with Express?
  - A first attempt might include rendering pages like a traditional server-side application.
  - In a second attempt, you could take the JavaScript from your Rails-version of IdeaBox and retrofit it on top of a RESTful API built in Express.
  - (For either of these, don't worry too much about databases, you can store all of your objects in array in memory or something along those lines.)

### Exploring JavaScript Events with Hardware (1:00 - 4:00)

Yesterday, we continued our discussion on events in JavaScript and how they allow for a lot of interesting approaches to programming. A really good example of this is hardware/robotics. You robot hits a wall; it fires an event saying it hits a wall; you turn it around.

This afternoon, we'll be exploring events (along with some other JavaScript concepts) with hardware (e.g. Arduinos).

- We'll be using the [johnny-five](http://johnny-five.io/) library
- And, we'll be working through [some of the following challenges][ardx]
