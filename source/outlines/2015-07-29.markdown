### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800, and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

(This is actually one of those cases where a functional language like Clojure or JavaScript can be useful. See if you can solve it in a functional language.)
