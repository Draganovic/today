### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

A garland word is one that starts and ends with the same N letters in the same order, 
for some N greater than 0, but less than the length of the word. I'll call the maximum N for 
which this works the garland word's degree. For instance, "onion" is a garland word of degree 
2, because its first 2 letters "on" are the same as its last 2 letters. The name "garland 
word" comes from the fact that you can make chains of the word in this manner:

`onionionionionionionionionionion...`

Today's challenge is to write a function garland that, given a lowercase word, returns the 
degree of the word if it's a garland word, and 0 otherwise.


garland("programmer") => 0

garland("ceramic") => 1

garland("onion") => 2

garland("alfalfa") => 4
