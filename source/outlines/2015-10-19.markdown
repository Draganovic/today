### All: Spiraling Design & Test (1:00 - 3:00)

Join Horace in Classroom A.

We've talked about this idea of "spiraling" the design of a solution. You start
with the most trivial of test cases and work outwards. Sounds easy, right? It's
hard to do. Let's practice with a real problem.

1. Get together with the pair listed below
2. Read [the Credit Check challenge](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/credit_check.markdown)
3. Use the strategies we discussed earlier this week to setup a plan of attack
especially focusing on test cases of slowly increasing difficulty
4. Then it's time to write code. Work next to each other and be each other's first-choice
helper when questions/problems pop up. But each of you should do your own programming
on your own computer.

Here are your random pairings:

* Hector Huertas Baeza & Lauren Thomson
* Penney Garrett & Brant Wellman
* Jordan Lawler & Taylor Moore
* Beth Sebian & Brennan Holtzclaw
* Lenny Myerson & Aaron Greenspan
* David Codina & James Crockett
* Greg Armstrong & Brenna Martenson
* Emily Blanchard & Beth Secor
* Dan Winter & Steven Olson
* Steve Pentler & Admir Draganovic
* Toni Rib & Joseph Perry
* Alexis Uriel Navarrete on fill-in/solo duty
