### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

Thursday is JavaScript day!

Given the following two arrays:

var firstList = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"];

var secondList = ["C", "E", "F"];

Write a function that removes all of the elements in the secondList from the firstList.

The result should be ["A", "B", "D"].
