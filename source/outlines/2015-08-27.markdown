1. First, turn to the people on either side of you, and tell them the 4 main directories, and ask them to tell you as well.
2. Read your sentence or more to them. When they read theirs think of one question to ask. Examples: Why is that important to you? How will you do that?
3. Play Simon for 1 minute each: https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/3de9c9729481c59bcebc6f30b4f10ea52ed5d36c/shell.md#keybindings

Can you still do the 2 katas in under 20 seconds? ([here](https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/3de9c9729481c59bcebc6f30b4f10ea52ed5d36c/shell.md#kata-2),
and [here](https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/3de9c9729481c59bcebc6f30b4f10ea52ed5d36c/shell.md#kata-3))

If you see something in the environment that could be improved on in under 3 minutes of effort... improve it.
If not, imagine all the people who gave enough of a shit to improve all the deficiencies for you before you got there.
Whoever they were, no one told them to do it, they just saw a need and gave enough of a shit to fill it.

Reread what you wrote on Monday about what it would look like, during your time here, to practice the hard and soft skills.
Choose one of these questions and answer it in 3 sentences or less
(if you have the desire to do more, that is fine, but the requirement is only 1):

* How have you been applying the ideas from the book?
* What things are you doing to apply them well?
* What ways have they worked out already?
* What ways could they be better
* What other things could you apply these ideas to?
* What is the biggest thing you could change that would improve your chances of success here?

Go find someone in Foxtrot and ask them to tell you something they learned this week.
If it's something you already know, listen and let yourself feel joy for them that they
got to learn this thing. If it's something new to you, then listen and let yourself feel
curiosity about what confusions it might solve. If it's something you are pretty sure they
are wrong about, then let them finish, and enjoy their enthusiasm
(their curiosity and motivation will lead them to the vibrant discovery
of how their understanding needs to be amended, don't kill it...
besides, it could be that it's *you* whose wrong ;)
