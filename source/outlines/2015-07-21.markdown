## All

### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Five points for posting your working solution in #warmup-answers by 9:00am.

### All: Character Count (9:30 - 11:00)

Continue in the Big Workspace with Mike on the character count exercise.
Here's the plan:

First, take five minutes to [read the Character Count challenge](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/character_count.markdown)

Second, get together with a person near you spend 15 minutes brainstorming:

* What things/ideas/tools have you used before will be useful for this problem?
* What would a trivial input be like? Minimum work? Minimum work +1?
* How would you structure a test that, if it passes, you know you're done?
* What kind of edge cases might you run into?
* Is there anything ambiguous about the challenge itself?
* Can you write out a logical flow for the algorithm in English?

Third, work by yourself for forty minutes to implement it stopping at 10:30.

Fourth, spend 10 minutes comparing solutions with your previous pair. Did you
run into the same snags? Make the same progress?

Last, let's spend about 15 minutes looking at a few individual solutions.
