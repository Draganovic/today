Today in 1884, the first cornerstone for the Statue of Liberty is laid.

### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

So, Ruby (and some other languagesâ€”apparently, there are other languages) have a data structure called Set.

A set is like an Array, but it holds unique objects.

If you had a set [1, 2, 3] and you tried to push in 3, you'd still have the same set.

Can you implement this with tests? What about shift and unshift? pop?

### All: Loopback: Refactoring Enigma (10:30 - 12:00)

Let's stay in the Big Workspace to practice a bit of pairing and refactoring.

Start by [cloning this Enigma project](url). Remember some of the named refactorings
you've worked with: Move Method, Extract Class, etc. Then begin refactoring the
application by:

1. Finding hotspots
2. Determining the test coverage of the code (*hint: add an intentional bug, like
  `5/0`, and see which if any tests fail*)
3. Augment the tests with additional edge case tests if the coverage is not
sufficient.
4. Run the tests and make sure they pass. If any fail, fix those first.
5. Apply one or more of your named refactorings and, after each one, both
confirm that the tests still pass and commit the results to git.

You can find several resources about the named refactorings including:

* [Fowler's original catalog (in Java)](http://refactoring.com/catalog/)
* [A little more polished version of the same catalog](https://refactoring.guru/catalog)

### All: Work Time (1:00 - 4:00)

Then this afternoon you have a bit more work time as you push SalesEngine closer
to the finish line.
