### Echo: Lunch Evals (12:00 - 2:30)

Meet at the Vault in the upper room for lunch.
We'll check out the solutions, and grade them.

Maybe try to write the whole thing again together as a big group project!

Maybe try to hook them up to rack,
it's the thing that defines the interface we're matching.
To do that, we just have to set some extra keys in the `env` hash
([https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/028438ffffd95ce1f6197d38c04fa5ea6a034a85/lib/rack/lint.rb#L65](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/028438ffffd95ce1f6197d38c04fa5ea6a034a85/lib/rack/lint.rb#L65))
Maybe add middleware (guess what middleware is...
if you guessed "linked list", you'd be right!)

### Echo: Adding JSON to Headcount (2:30 - 4:00)

Omg, more projects?
Yep, more projects, We're going to make our Headcounts parse JSON!
It's like CSV but about a million times better.
Imma let y'all try on your codebases so you can feel the pain of your decisions,
then Imma give you mine to actually do it on, so you can feel the difference.
What's the difference? It's that I kept all the knowledge of the CSVs out of my instances.
Remember how I said that like a hundred times? This should help make it concrete.

Oh! We could serve that JSON from our servers!
Then if we call `DistrictRepository.from_api("http://localhost:9292/districts.json")`,
it could call out to our server to get the JSON data
rather than pulling it out of a file
to initialize the DistrictRepository with!
You don't normally get to play with fun stuff like that until module 3
I love it! Lets do it!
