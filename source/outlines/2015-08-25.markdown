### Echo - String and Integer Riddles (9:30 - 10:30)

NOTE: If you don't know what strings / integers are, let me know.

Launch pry and see what methods exist on a string:

(if yours doesn't work: `$ gem install pry` and try again)

```
[1] pry(main)> string = "hello"
=> "hello"

[2] pry(main)> ls string
Comparable#methods: <  <=  >  >=  between?
String#methods:
  %            chr             gsub       rindex       succ!
  *            clear           gsub!      rjust        sum
# ...
```

As you work your way through this, think about what names you might choose
to for the methods that do these jobs. Then see if those names are in the list.
If they are, try them out and see if they give you what you expect.

* Find a way to improve the environment before you leave today.
  Take a level of ownership as if this was your home, and empower yourself to make something better.
  Maybe you see someone struggling with something and you can offer help (opening a door,
  figuring out a challenge, installing their environment).
  Maybe you see something that is causing an issue for students generally (a full trash can,
  a furniture layout that is causing logistical issues, a cord that people are tripping over,
  an empty pot of coffee, an issue with the scavenger hunt implementation).
  Whatever it is, empower yourself to improve it, and do so.
  Make the environment better for others, and express appreciation as they make it better for you.
  Invest in your community.
