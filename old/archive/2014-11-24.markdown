## All

### Warm Up

ISO 8601 standard for dates tells us the proper way to do an extended day is `yyyy-mm-dd`.

Write a method or function that can take any of the dates in [this gist][gist] and correctly format them to the ISO standard. You'll encounter dates in the following formats:

* `yyyy-mm-dd`
* `mm/dd/yy`
* `mm#yy#dd`
* `dd*mm*yyyy`
