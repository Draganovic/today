## Maria Thomas

This afternoon we'll be joined by Maria Thomas over Skype. I've asked her to talk with you around two topics:

* A) What should you, as potential employees, look for in the team and organizational leadership 
* B) As engineers, how do you make sure you're building the *right* thing, not just *a* thing?

## Services Tutorials

Work in a small, assigned group through the tutorials at http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/monsterporium/

Even if you're not participating in the team projects, you should still work with these groups on these tutorials.

Jorge will generally be available to help you out while Jeff & Katrina are doing assessments.

### Working Groups

* Katrina Engelsted & Romeeka Gayhart & Simon Taranto & Rolen Le
* Bryana Knight & Magan Adam & Jonah Moses & Brian Winterling
* Louisa Barrett & Nikhil Taneja & Billy Griffin & Nathaniel Watts
* Antony Siegert & Kevin Powell & Tyler Long & Will Mitchell
* Ben Lewis & Luke Martinez & Darryl Pequeen & Ben Horne
* Bree Thomas & Persa Zula & Lauren Spath Luhring & George Hudson 

## Services Projects

This week you'll be working on your own. Next week we'll have more support time with product/technical coaching.

Nevertheless, push yourselves to do things the way you know they should be done. Write stories, plan iterations, and start with the concrete things first. Figure out how to deliver a working prototype by next Monday.
