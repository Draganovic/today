## All

### Posse Time (8:30 - 9:00)

When Slack acquired ScreenHero, they shut down registrationsâ€”but existing users can still invite new users. Please invite the 1502 members in your posse. After they have registered, they can fill out the form below to have us pay for their account.

* [How to invite people to ScreenHero](http://blog.screenhero.com/post/110852538851/already-a-screenhero-user-heres-how-to-invite)
* [1502: Fill out this form once you have your account](https://docs.google.com/a/casimircreative.com/forms/d/1wJUbwB0doGgeyp9rGDt14aHtNE8nGlRueoSe_qpVRr4/viewform)

### Lightning Talks (2:15 - 3:10)

Gather in the big workspace for lightning talks.

* Nathan Owsiany: Ruby Microframeworks
* Teresa Finn: Gardening & Technology
* Timothy Mee: Who Is John Backus?
* Laura Whalin: How to Make Awesome Wireframes
* Kate Lane: Breaking the Grid
* DJ Greenfield: Portrait of a Language as a Young Program
* Lydia Shafer: 3D Printing
* Trey Tomlinson: LAME MP3

### Electives (3:10 - 4:00)

We'll stay in the workspace right after lightning talks to introduce the next round of electives.

#### Build a Web Server with Josh Cheek

The material is [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/electives/building-a-webserver).

In this class, we will understand the web and HTTP by building a webs erver.

You will need to have familiarity with classes, methods, and string manipulation. You might get to work with blocks, unless I can think of an elegant way to avoid them.

We will see what makes a request a GET or POST request, what headers and cookies actually are, where HTML fits into all of this, how a redirect works, etc.

As usual, you'll get my flavor of TDD and design.

#### Resuscitating an Open Source Project with Jeff

A few years ago I wrote [a gem named Draper](https://github.com/drapergem/draper). Since then it's
fallen into a bit of disrepair. For this three-class elective we'll try to get it
back on track.

Coming in to this elective you need to:

* Understand the basics of Rails applications (1409 yes, 1410 yes, 1412 maybe)
* Be comfortable with TDD
* Be ready for a lot of unguided work (aka this is not a follow-along-with-what-I-tell-you kind of class)
* Have a desire to dig into to some fucked up parts of Rails
* Be up for writing documentation

For this elective I'd like to have no more than *eight people*.

#### Using Jekyll to Create a Blog Hosted on Github Pages with Rachel

Jekyll is a Ruby gem that provides a (relatively) simple way to build a blog using templates, partials, markdown, code snippets, etc. In this elective, we'll learn how to generate a Jekyll project, preview content on localhost, and use Github Pages to host and publish your blog.

We'll treat this elective more like a workshop than a class.

#### ActiveRecord Golf ####
See how efficiently you can filter data using ActiveRecord queries.

Each week we will have three 'holes' (like holes on a golf course). These holes will be bits of code that are filtering data using Ruby, but can be improved by using ActiveRecord.

We will use different tools and gems to measure the performance of the original code and the refactored code.

We'll keep a running score that will carry across all three weeks.

By the end of the three weeks you should have a solid understanding of:

* `has_many :through`
* polymorphism
* self-referential associations

#### Intro to Clojure ####

Clojure is a Lisp implemented on top of the Java Virtual Machine. It offers some powerful tools for functional programming

In the first session we'll get set up with the language, review some basic syntax, and look at some common tools. In later sessions we'll pair up and work through some exercises to get comfortable with clojure's syntax and functional approach to solving problems. Throughout the elective we'll discuss some of the history of Lisp as a family of languages and the ideas behind functional programming in general.
