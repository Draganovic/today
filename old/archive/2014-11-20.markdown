## All

Thursday is JavaScript day. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is your friend.

Pick a method from Ruby's `Enumberable` that is not `map`, `collect`, `reduce`, `inject`, `each`, or `filter`.

Can you implement it in JavaScript?

You may want to look to [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) for inspiration.
