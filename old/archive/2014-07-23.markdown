### Warmup

Let's get back into Exercism work. For warmup today, nitpick at least three
solutions submitted by other users. Keep in mind that nits don't have to be
just hating -- you can complement the things you like, too.

### Warmup

Please complete [this logic problem](http://cl.ly/3v1m2T411O2q) by yourself.

### Mythical Creatures (9:00-12:00)

This morning we're going to work on the Mythical Creatures exercises.

#### Setup

Here's how to get the files you need. In your Terminal:

* switch to the directory where you'll keep your projects
* clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:turingschool/ruby-exercises.git`
* change to the mythical creatures directory: `cd ruby-exercises/mythical-creatures`
* open the folder in your editor: `atom .`

#### Doing the Work

The recommended order is:

* `unicorn_test.rb`
* `vampire_test.rb`
* `dragon_test.rb`
* `hobbit_test.rb`
* `pirate_test.rb`
* `wizard_test.rb`
* `medusa_test.rb`
* `werewolf_test.rb`
* `centaur_test.rb`

Your general process is:

1. Run the test file (like `ruby unicorn_test.rb`)
2. If the tests fail, read the output / error messages and fix them
3. If the tests pass, see if there are any more tests in that file which have a `skip`. Remove the next `skip` and goto step 1.
4. If you've completed all the tests for that file, then move on to the next.

#### Schedule

We're going to try a bit of independent work mixed with pairing.

##### Independent Session (9:00-10:00)

Let's spend the first hour working on your own.

##### Pairing Session (10:00-11:00)

Next let's get together in the following pairs:

* Glen Egbert & Ian Andersen
* Kavita Sachdeva & Jim Sutton
* Aaron Paul Wortham & Luke Aiken
* Sara Simon & Rolando Navarette

While you're pairing, use these techniques:

* Both halves of the pair keep their hands on keyboards at all times
* The person typing at the moment is the *driver* and the other half is the *navigator*.
The driver's job is just to be the typist and double-checker, the navigator does the
thinking, logic, and dictates the code they want to see.
* Every three lines of code or sooner use the phrase *tag* to signal that it's
time to swap roles.

##### Independent Session (11:00-12:00)

Finally let's spend the last hour working alone.

#### Extra Challenges

Too easy? See the `README` in the Mythical Creatures folder for some extra
challenges.

### Scavenger Hunt (1:00-4:00)

This afternoon Susannah will coordinate the scavenger hunt.

#### Team 1

* Glen Egbert
* Kavita Sachdeva
* Aaron Paul Wortham
* Sara Simon

#### Team 2

* Ian Andersen
* Jim Sutton
* Luke Aiken
* Rolando Navarette
