### Personal Retrospective 10:00-10:30

Wednesday we talked about focus as individuals and as a group. For your personal retrospective, please write/think about some of the following:

* What are you focused on learning over the coming three weeks?
* What are you focused on achieving?
* How do you focus best? What specific tools, techniques, places, or people make it happen?
* Are you building those supports into your day-to-day?
* What will it look like when you achieve these goals? How will you know they've been achieved?
