## Retrospective

With just four work days this week, let's do a retro this morning.

### Individual (9:00-9:35)

* How has SalesEngine progressed so far? Have you been able to track the goals
you set out for at the beginning of the project?
* As you look back at our first five weeks, what topics are you feeling good
about? Which are still shakey?
* The first class assessment is early next week. What parts will you excel, and
what will you struggle with? What should/could you do to prepare?
* We have 22 more weeks together. How will you take advantage of the people
around you to accelerate your learning? How will you accelerate theirs?

### Group

* Posses
* Git workflows
* Better pairing
