## Everyone

### Warmup

Please complete [this logic problem](http://cl.ly/1M0B1j273Q1R) solo,
then vote for your answers on the front board.

### Posse Meeting Time (3:00-4:00)

#### Organizing (3:00-3:15)

* Make pairing appointments with each other student in your posse
* Reach out to mentors about setting up pairing or code review sessions

#### Experiment with jQuery

Tomorrow night the community night will feature JavaScript exercises using jQuery. It'd be great to have you if you can spare the time.

Today, work with your posse to try out some of the jQuery exercises. They're in increasing order of difficulty, so skip ahead if your group is already somewhat familiar/comfortable with JavaScript.

### Web Applications with Ruby Midway Assessment (9:00-Noon)

It's time for an assessment on Sinatra skills, but you're skills need more
refinement.

This morning we'll work on the assessment itself in a non-evaluative context.

#### Session 1: Solo (9:00-10:00)

Let's pretend you're in test mode. Attempt to complete the Challenges
in the assessment on your own.

[SinatraCMS Assessment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/assessments/sinatra_cms.html)

#### Session 2: Pair Redux (10:00-11:00)

In this second session you need to:

* Find a pair
* Get back to the original SinatraCMS (git reset or checkout a new copy)
* Work through the challenges again from the beginning

Think of this as more like our assessments. You both kind of know where
the problem is going, but still stay grounded in the problem/solution
process. Don't try to "remember" what you did before, just solve the problem
as it emerges.

#### Session 3: Pair Nouveau (11:00-Noon)

Finally let's push into a new problem.

* Find a *new* pairing partner
* Get back to the original SinatraCMS
* Jump right to Challenge 3

We're assuming that you haven't gotten to Challenge 3 in the previous iterations, so this should be a fresh problem. Tackle it with your pair.

### Understanding MVC (1:00-2:30)

Meet with Jeff in the **classroom space** to discuss MVC.

#### Key Ideas

Here's [an illustration of the whole flow](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/images/rails_mvc.png).

### Understanding REST (2:30-4:00)
