#### Instructions

When you're *not* in your instructor assessments you'll assess and refactor each
other's code.

##### Peer Assessment

Your pair will assess someone else's project:

* Clone the submissions repo and use your section of the SalesEngine page for
recording your notes and scores
* Clone their SalesEngine project to your machine
* Work through the assessment rubric adding your own notes and scores
for your peer's project to the submission repo
* When done, add, commit, and submit a PR to submissions

##### Refactoring

* In your local clone of your peer's project, create a "refactoring" branch
* As a pair, find three places you can meaningfully improve the code. Make
each refactoring in a separate commit.
* Submit a pull request to the original project
