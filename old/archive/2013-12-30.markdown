* How did deliverables come together?
* Were you satisfied with the book? Why/why not?
* Who would you recommend it to?

#### Video Chat Setup

The first person listed above for your group should...

```

### Full-Group 3:30-4:00

We'll attempt to use some Google Hangouts on Air thing, if I can figure out how it works. I'll send an invite to two group members during your small group session.

### Selecting New Texts
