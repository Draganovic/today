## Everyone

One thing we heard last Friday is that we all need to do a better job with names.
Let's do name tags all this week to help each other out. We'll also work to get
everyone's headshots visible so you can study/check/practice.

### Warmup

This morning please [complete the following logic problem](http://cl.ly/0d1N3B3p0X0W)
using the pairs below:

* Konr Josef Laron & Ian Andersen
* Jim Sutton & Tan Doan
* Jonmichael Chambers & Aaron Paul Wortham
* Jessica Goulding & Kate Lane
* Christopher Bynum & Rolando Navarrete
* Luke Aiken & Hilary Denton
* Chad Brading & Alex Jensen
* David Bayendor & Emily Davis
* Corey Davis & Timothy Mee
* Horacio Chavez & Danny Glunz
* Eric Fransen & Kavita Sachdeva
* Marc Garreau & Zachary Routhier
* Allison Larson & Herbert Joseph
* Tim Proctor & Sara Simon
* Chase van Hekken & Andrew Watkins
* Robert Gu & Glen Egbert
* Alan Smith & Gregory Narajka
* Adam Smith & Will Faurot
* Victoria Harrod & Sam Kuhlmann
* Cara Dennis & Kalah Cheek
* Travis Yoder & Andy Mention
* Chandra Carney & Gustavo Villagrana

How will you find this person if you don't know their face? Try sending them
a direct message on Slack!

### Posse Time (3:00-4:00)

For your posse time this afternoon please...

### Administrative Business (3:00-3:10)

* setup pairing appointments
* send an email from all the students to your mentors about what's going on with
you this week
* complete any other coordination tasks you have pending

### Practice Reading Code (3:10-4:00)

If you have only three students, stick together. If you have four, break into
two pairs.

Then let's practice reading some open source code. Below are a few starter ideas.
You don't need to be familiar with these libraries, you can start by reading the README!

* Easy: [Faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker) - Say you want to add your first
and last name into the pool of names that Faker generates. How would you do that?
* Intermediate: [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) - How does the `get` method work? How does it make the HTTP parameters available to you as `params` vs when
using a block parameter with the call to `get`?
* Difficult: [Minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) - How does Minitest
find and run all the `test_` methods in a test file?

### Lightning Talks (4:15-4:45)

The following students join Jeff in classroom A to talk about your theme and topic.

You should [review the lightning talks instructions here](https://github.com/turingschool/lightning_talks) and come with two or
three ideas you'd like to pursue.

* _1406_: Chad Brading
* _1406_: Gustavo Villagrana
* _1406_: Hilary Denton
* _1406_: Corey Davis
* _1407_: Luke Aiken
* _1407_: Jessica Goulding
* _1407_: Kavita Sachdeva
* _1407_: Aaron Paul Wortham

## 1406

You'll be working in the Market Street space (Classroom B) all day.

### Revisiting Authorization Strategies (9:00-10:30)

Let's discuss the following:

* Brief review of role-based authentication and CanCan.
* Why that doesn't work for multi-tenant applications.
* Figuring out an alternative approach.
* Creating granular authorization logic.
* Implementing authorization on Ruby object.
* Implementing authorization on our data.
* Authoization based on scopes.

Try your hand at implementing per-user scoping [by working through a branch of Storedom in the following pairs](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/revisiting_authentication_and_authorization.html):

* Andy Mention & Chad Brading
* Alan Smith & Hilary Denton
* Corey Davis & Andrew Watkins
* Tim Proctor & Jonmichael Chambers
* Tan Doan & Allison Larson
* Horacio Chavez & Eric Fransen
* Gustavo Villagrana & Robert Gu
* Will Faurot & Marc Garreau & Emily Davis

### ActiveRecord Scopes & Queries (10:30-12:00)

We'll talk take a deeper dive into ActiveRecord scoping and queries:

* Recap of the basic query methods (`.where`, `.limit`, `.order`)
* Chaining and composing Active Record Queries
* Creating and overriding `default_scope`
* Creating scopes with lamdas and creating scopes that take parameters
* Emulating scopes with class methods

### Project Work Time (1:00-3:00)

Focus on the following:

* Implementing per-user scoping into your multi-tenant pivot.
* Implementing scopes to create composable queries in your application.
