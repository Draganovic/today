## Warmup

This morning let's try an infamous (but stupid) interview problem:

* Go through the numbers 0 through 100 (including both 0 and 100)
* If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
* If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
* Otherwise print the number

## Getting Started with CSVs

### Discussion (9:00-9:30)

First up, Jeff will give you an introduction to CSV files:

* What is a CSV?
* Where do they come from?
* Why are they used?
* Do we really need to know this?
* It's about data, not CSVs

### Practice (9:30-4:00)

We have a *stack* of CSV tutorials to work through in the next week or so. Today we'll start with Part 1:

This will likely take you the rest of the day. If you were to finish early, pick off a few more of your enumerable exercises.
