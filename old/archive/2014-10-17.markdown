### Personal Retro

When you are not in group retro please work on a personal retrospective
answering one or more of the following questions:

* Did you accomplish what you set out to do over the past six weeks?
* Where's your confidence level in your skills? What was the low-point over
the six week segment? High point?
* What did you learn about your classmates during the class? How did you help
build a group culture? What *role* will you play in the group during the next
class?
* What did you learn about our scoring (personal assessments, project evaluations)
during the class, and how did that influence your personal motivation? What are
the keys to keeping you invested in your work?
* What are you looking forward to about the next class? Why? What are you most
worried about?
