### Personal Retrospective

You have 25 minutes to write and publish a personal retrospective on your class blog including:

* A basic introduction to the project
* A recap of your work pattern (days, hours, working alone / with others)
* Link to your code repository
* Summary of your results/conclusions
* What worked and you'll do the same next time
* What didn't work and you'll change next time

### Group Retrospective

* How did the group perform, overall?
* Who supported you?
* Who kept the group spirit up?

## Focus Work

We'll split into 2 groups and focus on some of the concepts that we've previously worked on. The largest group will stay in the classroom, the other group will probably need to work in The Pit.

### Testing with Franklin

### Ruby Fundamentals with Katrina

We'll be building on yesterday's full-day workshop. Let's start by answering any questions that floated to the top of your mind overnight, then we'll look at Ruby in 100 Minutes and write tests for it.

  * EventManager
  * Encryptor
  * Enumerables
  * TDD with Minitest
