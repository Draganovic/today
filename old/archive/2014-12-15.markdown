## All

### Meet and Greet (8:00 - 9:00)

We'll skip warm ups today because 1412 will be meeting the instructors at 8:30. Please take some time to introduce yourselves to anyone and everyone from the new cohort.

1412 is going to work on Classroom A and the workspace on that
side today. We'd like to break down all the tables and so they
can be reorganized and re-leveled. We'd love a little help before
class starts.

### Posse Meeting Time (3:00 - 4:00)

Today, you'll meet in your new posses. Every posse will have a least one new member in it. So, you'll have to update some things and reintroduce yourselves.

#### Introduce yourself to your posse by answering the following questions

* Name and cohort?
* Where are you from originally?
* What brought you to Turing?
* What excites you most about the next six weeks at Turing?
* What do you think you dream job would be after graduating from Turing?
* What non-programming experience in your life do you think has best prepared you for being a developer?

#### Take care of administrative affairs

* Create/share a Google Calendar for your posse. You can use this calendar to request pairing sessions, set posse meet-ups, etc.
* Invite all posse members (students and mentors) to the calendar.
* Create and share a Google Doc to store contact info for your posse: name, email, Twitter, Github, phone, blog…
* Join the Slack channel for your posse

#### Find some common ground

* Your posse is named after a well known computer scientist. Who is this person and why are their contributions significant?
* What is a core value of your posse? Some examples: grit, perseverance. Why is this value important to being a developer?

#### Gather some intelligence

* Use Google, Github, Twitter, etc. to research your posse mentors. Even if your mentors haven't changed from last module, they might be up to something new and interesting.

#### Pass down some wisdom

* What should 1412 know about life at Turing? (e.g. time management, the extra set of bathrooms on the first floor and in the new space, the waffle truck)
* What should 1410 know about module two?
* What should 1409 know about module three?
* What are some habits you wish you formed early on? (e.g. technical blogging, warm-ups, reading)

### Homework

Tonight you need to build a solution to the [99 Bottles Challenge](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/99_bottles.markdown).

* You'll reference your solution in class tomorrow, so make sure it's done and works correctly.
* This is meant to be an independent exercise, but it's better to get a little help then to not complete it.
* Keep your solution simplistic -- use the most basic tools you can based on what you learned in the prag studio materials.

**Submission**: Create a [gist](http://gist.github.com) and add the URL for your Gist to [this MoPad document](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/4gMPgXQ7Oe).
