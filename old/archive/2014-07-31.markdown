## 1407

### Thinking in Algorithms

First up this morning you'll work with Rachel in the classroom space.

### Ruby's Object Model

Next up you'll work with Josh to begin exploring Ruby's Object Model.

This will cover:

1. Classes and Instances
2. Bindings
3. Variables
4. Method lookup / invocation

The material is located [here](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/9d99becad60d5d2a57b8).

### Encapsulation & Decomposition

This afternoon Jeff will discuss the ideas of encapsulation and decomposition.

#### Key Ideas / Questions

* "Churn" and "Why does code change?"
* Responsibilities
* [Object-oriented programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_oriented) and message passing
* [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
* [Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)) or API

#### Example

As a discussion point, we'll talk about [the Battleship project](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/battleship.html).
Please find a few minutes to read the project description.

### Number Systems

Then last for the day we'll discuss [Number Systems](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/number_systems.html)
(binary, octal, and hexadecimal).
