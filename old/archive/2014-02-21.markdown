## Retrospective

It's our last "normal" retrospective session!

### Personal Retrospective

Please write from 9:00-9:30 about the following:

* What are the things you're most proud of from your work in the course?
* What do you wish you'd done differently?
* Who has surprised you along the way?
* If you could choose to work with one person from our class for the next two years, who would it be? Why? Who would choose you?
* How are you going to continue learning once you're in your job?
