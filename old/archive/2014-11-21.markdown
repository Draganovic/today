### Study Groups and Peer Mentoring (9:00 - 10:40)

* **Jessica** has spent the better part of the week scraping websites and will running a session on "Web Scraping for Fun and Profit" in **Classroom A**.
* **Will** is going to be solving a number of Project Euler problems in JavaScript in **Classroom C**.
* **Jeffrey Wan** is running an _RTanque Dojo_ study group in **Classroom B**.

**Robert, Jonmichael, Will, and Watts** have offered to mentor students from 1407, 1409, and 1410. Seek them out if there is something you're struggling with or if you want to take on a new challenge. Pick an Exercism? Tackle a problem on Project Euler? Try to solve one of those JavaScript problems from yesterday?

Come with a problem/question or just come ready and willing to hack on something with them. If you haven't gotten a chance to work with them, ask around—they're great mentors. They're willing to work one-on-one as well as in groups.
