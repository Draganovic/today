## Retrospective

### Personal Retrospective

You have 25 minutes to write and publish a personal retrospective on your class blog including:

* How was working in a pair for over a week? Did you feel like you were twice as productive? What was harder and what was easier?
* You're now four weeks into the program. Have you mastered more or less than you would have predicted? Why?
* If you had to guess now, where are your skills going to be in five months? What will you intend to do after the program?
* What learning strategies are working best for you so far? Why?

### Group Retrospective

* Who were you collaborating with most this week? Why?
* Has your progress been faster or slower than you expected?
* What was your favorite session as a full or small group? Least favorite?
* Three shout-outs
