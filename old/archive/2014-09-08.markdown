## Posse Meetup Time

Today, you'll meet in your new posses. Every posse will have a least one new member in it. So, you'll have to update some things and reintroduce yourselves.

### Introduce yourself to your posse by answering the following questions

* Name and cohort?
* Where are you from originally?
* What brought you to Turing?
* What excites you most about the next six weeks at Turing?
* What do you think you dream job would be after graduating from Turing?
* What non-programming experience in your life do you think has best prepared you for being a developer?

### Take care of administrative affairs

* Create/share a Google Calendar for your posse. You can use this calendar to request pairing sessions, set posse meetups, etc.
* Invite all posse members (students and mentors) to the calendar.
* Create and share a Google Doc to store contact info for your posse: name, email, Twitter, Github, phone, blogâ€¦
* Join the Slack channel for your posse

### Find some common ground

* Your posse is named after a well known computer scientist. Who is this person and why are their contributions significant?
* What is a core value of your posse? Some examples: grit, perseverance. Why is this value important to being a developer?

### Gather some intelligence

* Use Google, Github, Twitter, etc. to research your posse mentors.

### Pass down some wisdom

* What should 1409 know about life at Turing? (e.g. time management, the extra set of bathrooms on the first floor)
* What should 1407 know about module two?
