## Retrospective

### Personal Retrospective 9:00-9:30

Spend 30 minutes writing and publishing a personal retrospective on your class blog including:

* For this project, groups are taking a more serious approach to project management. How does that work with your style? Does it make you feel more organized or like you're wasting a lot of time?
* What's been hard, interesting, or surprising about building upon someone else's code base?
* With the class just past the halfway mark, how do you feel about your progress? Do you feel like your momentum is building or waning?
* What did you think about the Young Entrepreneurs project we kicked off yesterday?

Please come back to the classroom by 9:35.

## Flex Time

When you're not in 1-on-1s, work on something of your choosing which may (today) include your project.

*If* you work on your project, it'd be ideal to spend the time on the more challenging aspects. What are the parts you don't understand? Are there new technologies or libraries you want to integrate?
