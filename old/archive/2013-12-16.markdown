## Introduction to Key-Based Caching

### Using a Digest

The problem with caching web assets:

* Varnish
* Squid/Proxies
* Browser Cache

How can you use filenames to "bust" caches?

### Creating a Digest

```ruby
require 'digest/md5'
digest = Digest::MD5.hexdigest("here's my input string")
```

### Digest-Based Keys

* Modeling a "normal" cache
* Using a digest as the key
* Running out of space?
* Least recently used

### Tutorial

We've put together a tutorial on how to get started with digest-based caching: http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/performance/digest_based_caching.html
