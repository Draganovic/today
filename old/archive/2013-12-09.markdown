## Data Caching with Redis

### Part 1: Discussing Data Caching

* Why cache data?
* What is a cache?
* "Key-value store" like a hash
* Make up complex keys to avoid collisions
* Does data stay, get updated, or expire?

### Part 2: Experimenting with Redis

[Installing Redis Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/performance/installing_redis.html)

```plain
$ brew install redis
$ redis-cli
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> exit
```

#### Redis Gem

```plain
$ gem install redis
$ irb
001 > require 'redis'
 => true
002 > r = Redis.new
 => #<Redis client v3.0.4 for redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0>
003 > r.set("hello", "world")
 => "OK"
004 > r.get("hello")
 => "world"
005 > exit
```
