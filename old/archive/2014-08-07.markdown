## Everyone

We'll skip warmup this morning since you're likely
preoccupied with the assignments you have due today.

### Morning Work Time (9:00-Noon)

You have the morning to finish up your projects.

For 1406, if you finish your game, consider (a)
refactoring to improve the code quality or (b) trying
an extension *in a feature branch*.

For 1407, if you finish ContactManager, delete the
implementation of one or more controller methods and
see if you can reimplement it without guidance.

### Showcase (3:30-4:00)

This afternoon we'll have a showcase to show off Blogger,
ContactManager, Battleship, and Mastermind. If you've
built something you're ready to show off, please add your
name to the front whiteboard.

### ContactManager Group Wrapup (1:00-3:30)

To close out ContactManager we'll do a mix of full-group review
and refactor session in the **classroom**.

Here's our plan:

* Part 1: Questions. What makes the least sense? What parts were
you able to complete but don't understand how they work?
* Part 2: Looking at Controllers. Together we'll check
out some controller actions and discuss what makes a controller
"good" or "bad".
* Part 3: Paired refactoring. You'll pair up with a second person,
then grab a third person's project and work on improving the
code base.
