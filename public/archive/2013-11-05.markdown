## Dinner Dash Work Time

If you didn't already do so yesterday, the most important thing you can do during this time is plan how you'll complete the project.

* What's the most essential functionality?
* How soon can you get it up in production?
* What does a realistic roadmap of features look like between now and next Wednesday?

Then, on the people side:

* Do you have any known speedbumps (people out of town, etc)?
* Any scheduling constraints or considerations?
* Any conflicts (ex: lightning talks)?
* What is each team member looking to get out of the project?
