## Daily Outline

Today we will split into 3 groups and work all day.

There's a good chance that you will not be working with your pair today, and that's totally fine.

## Group 1: Refactoring with Franklin (9-12), Self-Directed (1-4)

If you've finished EventReporter or have more or less finished it, then you will spend the day with Franklin refactoring and working on better ways of solving it.

In the afternoon you're on your own. You may want to dive into git:

* [Think Like a Git](http://think-like-a-git.net)
* [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com)

Whatever you think will help you move forward.

## Group 2: On your own

If you're not done with EventReporter but you're making progress, keep working throughout the day. Jorge is available to answer questions.

## Group 3: Fundamentals with Katrina

If EventReporter is not making sense, or you feel that you're either not making progress, or are stuck, or that working on EventReporter is pointless -- Katrina will spend the day with you going over fundamentals.
