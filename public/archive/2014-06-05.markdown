## Warmup

Let's do one more logic problem for warmup:

## Git

This morning our goal is to both understand both (a) why and (b) how to use Git.

### Background

First let's set the stage and discuss Git at a high level.

* What is source control?
* Why use it?
* What came before git?
* What's in use now?
* Why was it created?
* What's the difference between git and GitHub?
* Centralized vs distributed source control
* Repo, branch, commit

### Source Control Made Easy

The late, great Jim Weirich explains source control and git better than we can. Let's check out his screencast:

### Try Git / Git Immersion

Now let's put in a bit of practice.

If you're brand new to git, start with try.github: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1

If you've used git before (or complete try.github), work through Git Immersion: http://gitimmersion.com/

And, if you just can't get enough Git, check out the Pro Git book: http://git-scm.com/book
