## Warmup

You've spent a lot of time creating mythical creatures, but you have yet to model a Phoenix: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology)

* Create a `phoenix_test.rb` file
* Add a few tests with behavior you'd expect from a magical bird of fire
* Create the implementation
* Add more tests/implementation until time is up

Consider using [the #1406 chatroom](https://turingschool.slack.com/messages/1406/) to discuss ideas for features.

## Starting IdeaBox with TDD (9:00-Noon)

This morning it's time to start your most sizable assignment yet, IdeaBox.

http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/ideabox/tdd_minitest.html

Please spend the morning working on it with the pair below. During wrap-up this afternoon we'll figure out the plan for completing it.

### Pairs

* Andy Mention & Allison Larson
* Tim Proctor & Marc Garreau
* Andrew Watkins & Cara Dennis
* Emily Davis & Robert Gu
* Chad Brading & Jonmichael Chambers
* Alan Smith & Tan Doan
* Will Faurot & Eric Fransen
* Jessica Goulding & Gustavo Villagrana
* Hillary Denton & Corey Davis & Horacio Chavez

## Enumerable Methods (1:00-4:00)

### Method Chaining & Seeing is Believing

First Josh will spend about one pomodoro talking about using Seeing is Believing to understand chains of method calls.

### Intro with Jeff

Then let's have a quick chat about the overarching concepts behind the Enumerable methods.

* Programming is about collections
* *Iterating* over a collection: `each`, `map`/`collect`, `inject`, `sort_by`
* *Filtering* a collection: `select`, `detect`, `min`, `max`
* Typically take a block and run it once for each element
* The right enumerable method can save you time/effort
* But everything can be done with `each`

### Exercises in Pairs

Once we've finished the group discussion you should dive into these exercises:
