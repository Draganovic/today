## Retrospective

We'll start off with a personal retrospective at 9:00. I'd like you to think/reflect on difficult problems -- those you're not sure can be solved -- which you've solved so far in the class, what's coming up in the last weeks, and what kinds of difficult problems you want to attack in your job.

We'll then do group retrospective 9:30-10:00
