## All

### Warm Up (8:30 - 8:50)

Can you implement `flatten` without using, uhm, `Array#flatten`? It should be able to handle nested arrays infinitely deep.

* If you did it without money patching `Array`, can you do it with monkey patching? (And vice versa, of course.)
* Can you do it in JavaScript?

We all did it on Friday and we'll show you our approaches at 8:55.

### Posse Meeting Time (3:00-4:00)

Meet with your posse and work on the following:

* 3:00 - 3:10 Share a project or assignment that you're working on.
* 3:10 - 3:20 Update your mentors through email or a blog post
* 3:20 - 4:00 1406 and 1407 proposed new projects today. 1409 is tackling their first, non-tutorial, Rails project: Dinner Dash. 1410 is knee deep in EventReporter.
  * 1406: What project did your team decide on? Your fellow posse members are potentially going to be users of this application. What would they like to see in it?
  * 1407: Talk about your self-directed project. Solicit ideas for features from your posse members
  * 1409: You were introduced to Dinner Dash today. Do 1406 and 1407 have any guidance for you? How do you feel about building a Rails application from the ground up?
  * 1410: With Mastermind behind you, you're moving onto EventReporter. What's different about this project? What's similar? What's confusing to you and what's old had at this point?
