## All

### Warm Up (8:30 - 8:50)

Today's date is January 12, 2015. If we formatted the date as `YYYYMMDD`, it would be 20150112.

If we added up all of the digits in the data, we'd get 12.

1. What if we added together all of the days in 2015? What value would we get?
2. What if we only added together all of the Fridays in 2015?
3. What's the highest value day of the week?

Tests or it didn't happen.

### Posse Time (3:00 - 4:00)

From 3:00 - 3:15, handle your normal posse business (e.g. updating mentors, schedule intra-posse pairing, etc.).

1407 is beginning work on their final projects, which are targeted at the Turing the community.

In order to make the best possible applications, they need your feedback. If your posse does not have a 1407 member, please seek out someone from 1407.

* [Jobs](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/jobs)

Please open issues or add to the wiki if you have any feature requests or ideas.

### The Daily Iteration (9:00 - 11:00)
