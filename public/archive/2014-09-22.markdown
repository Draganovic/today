### Sinatra Self-Assessment (9:00-11:00)

As we talked about on Friday, the assessment process is a little unusual for
this second class because we split time between Sinatra and Rails. Thus doing
a proper assessment today is not very helpful prep for the final assessment
that'll use Rails.

This morning please work in a pair to complete all three challenges in our
Sinatra assessment to find your weak points and gauge your understanding.

When you've completed the assignment then you can continue working on your
Blogger assignment.
