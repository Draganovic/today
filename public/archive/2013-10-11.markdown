### Personal Retrospective

Spend 30 minutes writing and publishing a personal retrospective on your class blog including:

* What were your takeaways from Focus Week? What do you understand better now than you did a week ago? What did you practice but still not master?
* What were the plusses and minuses of learning in a small, similar-skill-level group? Would you want to be broken up into small groups for the whole 24 weeks?
* How are you feeling about starting web applications next week? What do you think will be hard about it? What's exciting?

## Self-Directed Work

The only directive for this session is that you **do your work with at least one other person**. Do whatever you feel will help you consolidate your learning or move forward or inspire you.

Here are some suggestions:

### Work on Fundamentals

* Some Git with [Think Like a Git](http://think-like-a-git.net), [Git Immersion](http://http://gitimmersion.com), or [A Visual Guide to Version Control](http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/)

### Prep for Next Week

* Practice with HTML & CSS, guided by your new book
* Try out Sinatra with short intros like [1](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html), [2](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/singing-with-sinatra/), or [3](http://www.sitepoint.com/get-started-with-sinatra-on-heroku/)
* Learn about SQL including an [Introduction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), and [practice online tutorials](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Main_Page), or [text tutorials](http://www.baycongroup.com/tocsql.htm)
