## Warm-Up

Clone the [warmup-exercises](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises) repository on github.

At 8:50 we will release a warm-up exercise to be completed individually. You will have until 9:15 to write your program. At 9:15 we will release an automated test for the exercise, and spend 10 minutes going over any gotchas that you may have run into.

## Automated Testing Concepts

First, hop over to the [testing fundamentals page](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/$1).

## Introduction to MiniTest

Next, let's begin rebuilding [EventManager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/$1) using a test-driven approach and the MiniTest library.

[View the tutorial here](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/$1).

For the afternoon, you will continue working on building EventManager using TDD. You may elect to...
