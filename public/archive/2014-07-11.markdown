## OOP with Ruby Retrospective

We'll spend the bulk of our morning looking back at this class and thinking
about the next one.

### Feedback Survey (9:00-9:30ish)

First is the direct feedback. Please complete this survey: [Week 6 Feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18oIfj-PAlF9czeaYAA5Ap9obHfo6yEzEdODflVY4CS0/viewform?usp=send_form)

### Individual Writing (9:30ish-10:00)

Next please write an individual retro in response to one or more of the following
prompts:

* Are you satisfied with your progress so far? Is this where you thought you'd
be after six weeks? What factors are controlling your degree of success? Which
of those can you control, and which will you control differently in the next
class?
* What do you consider your top three achievements from the first six weeks and
why? What do you expect to achieve in the next class?
* Where do you think you rank in your class? What's your evidence? Do you think
you're moving up, sliding back, or holding steady?
* What's your plan for intermission week? Who will you work with to ensure
you're learning during the week? How will you know if your efforts are
successful?
* Who have been the top three influencers on you so far? How did they support
your learning? Why do you match up with them? What do they do that helps you?

### Group Discussion (10:00-10:30ish)

* Survey recap
* Individual writing recap
* Your questions and topics

## Posse Meeting Time

In your posses today we'd want you to try out a new programming language. As
a group, pick one of the following and work on it for the hour:

* [Go](http://www.golang-book.com/1/index.htm)
* [Python](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/)
* [JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript)
* [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html)

For any of those four languages please feel free to use learning resources
not listed above, too.

## Afternoon Plans

### Pairing with Steve Kinney

Four of you will have 1-on-1 pairing sessions with Steve this afternoon working
on Exercism exercises.

Recall that you can fetch a specific exercise with `exercism fetch ruby/exercisename`
where the exercise name is listed with your name below:

* 1:00 - Jessica - "raindrops"
* 1:45 - Gustavo - "food-chain"
* 2:30 - Corey - "anagram"
* 3:15 - Allison - "queen-attack"

### Independent Work Time

When you're not doing 1-on-1s or working with Steve, please work on something of
value. Some ideas:

* Could you build, from scratch, all of Mastermind in these three hours? If not,
could you at least build the core gameplay?
* Did the language you tried this morning catch your eye? Exercism has tracks for
each of them -- try solving a couple problems!
* Build your first Sinatra application: http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html
* Learn about databases and SQL [background](http://databases.about.com/od/sql/a/sql.htm) and [interactive tutorial](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Main_Page)
