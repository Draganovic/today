## Understanding Stories

### Overview

* Stories communicate intent and achievement
* Good stories are easy to understand
* Like any goals, they should be [SMART](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)

### Writing a Story

```plain
As a(n) [user type]
In order to [extract business value]
When I [take some action]
  (and [take some other action])
Then I [observe an outcome]
  (and I [observe another outcome])
```

### Points! Points! Points

* 3 Points - A vague idea we don't understand
* 2 Points - A concept that we understand, but it's too big to start work on
* 1 Point - A story that is understood and ready for work
