#### Debugging 1-4

Debugging with Josh. Material is [here](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/debugging/debugging.html).

#### Focus: Tagging

You've had some good exposure to pairing, but you don't have
a lot of "tooling" around how to be a good pair.

One simple idea to practice today is *tag*.

You **must** have two keyboards to pair effectively.
When you're ready to take control of the typing, you
say *tag*. If you're typing and you hear *tag*, it means
hands up/off the keyboard immediately, mid-word.

An effective pair is tagging at least every 90 seconds. Try
that today. It'll feel cheesy at first, but stick with it.
