Spend 30 minutes writing and publishing a personal retrospective on your class blog including:

* How does building web applications, so far, compare to building command-line applications?
* Have you been able to keep up the good habits you practiced during Focus Week, or did you have to make compromises? Why?
* Is working on an individual project proving or disproving your understanding of your skills? Has having a small team around you been helpful?

## Self-Directed Study

Please remember that this is **not** time for IdeaBox. Step away and work on **something different**. Get together with **at least one other person**. 

Here are some suggestions:

### Help Improve Ruby's Documentation
