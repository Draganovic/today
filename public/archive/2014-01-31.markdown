## Snowpocalypse

Class is cancelled. Please use the time to:

1. Get your portfolio info submitted.
2. Send out applications and emails.
3. Work on your project
4. Maybe work on a bit of open source? Open source contributions, even to lesser-known libraries are A) a great thing to do and B) very attention-grabbing to potential hire-ers.
