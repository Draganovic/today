## Warmup

Imagine you have eight developers (Alex, Bernadette, Charles, Dana, Eddie, 
Fernanda, Gus, and Hiro). They want to pair program together every day, but
they don't like to repeat pairs.

Write an algorithm to generate a daily schedule which has seven full days
of pairing schedules without a single repeated pair.
