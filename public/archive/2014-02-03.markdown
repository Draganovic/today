## SOA Q&A

Last week you were dumped into the world of services. Let's talk about the big picture.

* Why use services?
* How can you design an application for services?
* Are services the right choice for all projects?

## Asynchronous Messaging and Data

One of the great applications for services is to implement asynchronous messaging and data transfer. Let's look at how to do that in two parts:

* [Asynchronous Messaging with Redis/PubSub](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/asynchronous_messaging_with_pubsub.html)
* [Asynchronous Data with Faye](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/asynchronous_data_with_faye.html)
