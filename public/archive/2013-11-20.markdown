## JS Exercism (09:00 AM to 10:00 AM)

We will meet in the classroom and talk about a few JavaScript concepts:

* for loops (iterating)
* properties
* functions

The remainder of the time will be spent working through existing problems and asking questions about what was covered yesterday.

## What's Up With jQuery (10:00 AM to 11:00 AM)

We want to now take the **Bob** code we built yesterday and create an interactive conversation with Bob which allows us to type in various inputs and see the outputs.

* Downloading jQuery
* Building boilerplate HTML that includes jQuery and external JavaScript files
* Writing JavaScript within HTML using the **script** tag
* Searching and reading JQuery documentation

We will use the following process, written here in pseudocode, to solve this problem:

* Listen for when the user clicks on the submit button
* Prevent the default operation of reloading the page
* Find the input text field of our message we are going to send to Bob
* Create a new instance of Bob
* Send our Bob instance our input
* Store the results returned from Bob
* Find the location where we want to display the results
* Append our results to the destination location
