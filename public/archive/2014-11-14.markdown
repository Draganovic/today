the more reason to take a little bit of time to sharpen your tools.

There won't be one-on-ones today.

* Consider working through the [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/) workshops. **Steve** is clearing his
  schedule to exclusively answer JavaScript questions exclusively today.
* Consider working on the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) to sharpen your Ruby skills.
* Consider getting better with your tools. Take a look at [ShortcutFoo](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/) to
  learn your way around your editor.
* Consider taking one or more [Exercism](http://exercism.io) exercises in the language of your choice.
* We talked with Thoughtworks yesterday and they prefer that their applicants complete a challenge in Java.
  Consider tackling some Java today with [this course](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/).

  printing.
* **Kate** is running a study group on design from 10:45 - 12:00. Seek her out. She'll post her location on Slack.
