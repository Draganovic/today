## Getting Started with JavaScript and Jasmine (09:00 AM to 11:00 AM)

To gain understanding of JavaScript and testing with JavaScript we want to review the work that we have already accomplished with Bob.

* Review the concepts of Bob in Ruby
* Review the Bob tests in Ruby

Using the [Jasmine Documentation](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) as a reference we will convert the test suite from MiniTest to Jasmine.

* Converting MiniTest to Jasmine
* Using `describe`, `it`, and `expect`

With our test suite in place we can now solve **Bob** in JavaScript.

* Writing Bob in JavaScript

## JS Exercism (11:00 AM to 12:00 PM)

Exercism provides many possible tracks. One of those is JavaScript. The first exercise provided happens to be **Bob**. Solve the exercise and submit your work through Exercism.

## Practicing Core JavaScript 01:00 PM to 04:00 PM 

### Work Pattern

Similar to this morning, we will continue to learn JavaScript by:

* Understanding the concepts of the problem in Ruby
* Converting the test suite from MiniTest to Jasmine
* Composing a solution in JavaScript

Your pair can choose to:

* A) Stay in the classroom and mix independent work with Frank-led sessions
* B) Work independently outside the classroom
