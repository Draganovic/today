## Dinner Dash Work Time

During our final work session for the project you should make sure:

* A) Your code is deployed and working in production (ie: Heroku)
* B) You have one or more people *not* on your team try using it
* C) You clean up rough edges in the code like methods that are too long, commented out code, etc
* D) Run a code-coverage tool to figure out which parts of your code are untested (with a tool like [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) )

Just FYI, only projects that demonstrate good practices in the implementation, tests, and UI/UX will be demoed tomorrow.
