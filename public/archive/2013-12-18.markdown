## Technical Reviews

### Areas of Focus

As we look through your project we're assessing these four areas of focus:

* 1) Modeling - multitenancy, pushing logic down the stack, security
* 2) Interface - light view templates, logical and clean UX
* 3) Performance - database indicies, implementing caching, background workers
* 4) Process - test driven development, using Pivotal Tracker

In each area we'll render an evaluation of:

* 4 - Exceeded expectations, went above and beyond what you were *supposed* to do
* 3 - Met expectations
* 2 - Below expectations, made an attempt but really didn't hit the goal
* 1 - Far below expectations, no effort or no effective effort
