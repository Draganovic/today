## Everyone

### Posse Meeting Time (3:00-4:00)

This afternoon with your posse please:

* Make sure everyone has ScreenHero setup and add each other as contacts.
Remember to use the same email as your Slack account so you can `/hero` people.
* Send email to your outside mentors to let them know what your up to. Inquire
whether they're available to pair or code review this week.
* Each student member schedule at least one pairing hour with each other
student in the group. This could be used to focus on class work or work on
something like a kata/exercism.

Then, when you finish those, spend the rest of your time getting better at
programming. A few ideas:

* Can you find all prime numbers between 1-10000 using the sieve of Eratosthenes?
* Write an algorithm that, given three sorted collections, can turn them into
a single sorted collection.
* Given a hex-color input, like #F6336A, figure out the dominant resulting color,
like "red" here. Implementing "red", "green", and "blue" should be easy-ish, but
can you handle variations like "purple" (high blue + red)?

### Acceptance Testing with Capybara (9:00-Noon)

We didn't implement any tests while building IdeaBox, and that's not a
good thing. Today we'll learn how to test web apps using Capybara.

During our session, we'll cover the following topics,

1. What is a feature test
2. How to setup Capybara with Sinatra
3. How to template a feature test
4. The essential Capybara searching features
5. The essential Capybara interaction features
6. How to debug a feature test

### Scraping & Parsing with Nokogiri (1:00-3:00)

For your clone wars project, you need to scrape data from a website.
...but how do you do that?

Never fear, students, we considered this!
Lets talk about web scraping with Nokogiri :D

We'll go over [this](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/mechanize.html)
tutorial, learning what web scraping is and how it works,
and then using it to get book data for our list of ISBNs.

Be prepared to play around and to flex those CSS selector skills you've been practicing :)

### Lightning Talk Prep (4:00)

### Warmup

This morning please spend your warmup time getting started with Exercism.io.

The process includes:

* Setup an account on the site
* Download/run the command line interface (CLI) program ([Installing the CLI](http://help.exercism.io/installing-the-cli.html))
* It'll ask for your username and API key from the site
* Pick where you want to store your exercises (`~/exercism/` is a good choice)

If you're doing things much more complicated than that, you're probably doing
the wrong thing.

If you get it setup, then go ahead and fetch/begin the first exercise.
