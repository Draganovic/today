## All

### Self-Study (9:00 - 11:00)

This morning, please _respect the Friday_ and do not work on your project. You should, instead, choose one or more of the following:

#### Join a Study Group

* **Will and Andy** are running a study group on [Tmux][tmux], the terminal multiplexer. Seek them out if you want to become a command line wizard.
* **David and Travis** are running a [Github][] study group—this session is *highly recommended* for 1410.
* **Hilary** is running a study group on the most popular programming language in the world: JavaScript.
* **Kate** is running a design study group. Want to make your applications look as good as they work? Join her group!
* **Marc and Tan** are running an *Introduction to Vim* study group. It'll probably be better than Steve's morning sessions.

[Github]: http://github.com
[tmux]: http://tmux.sourceforge.net/
[Vim]: http://www.vim.org/

(Let Steve know if you'd like to run a study group.)

#### Work with a Peer Mentor

**Robert, Jonmichael, and Watts** have offered to mentor students from 1407, 1409, and 1410. Seek them out if there is something you're struggling with or if you want to take on a new challenge. Pick an Exercism? Tackle a problem on Project Euler? Try to solve one of those JavaScript problems from yesterday?

Come with a problem/question or just come ready and willing to hack on something with them. If you haven't gotten a chance to work with them, ask around—they're great mentors. They're willing to work one-on-one as well as in groups.

#### Technical Blogging

Have you figured something out? Write a technical blog post. [Check out some of the posts written by your fellow students this week.](https://github.com/turingschool/student_blogging/blob/master/week%20of%202014-10-27.markdown) Keep in mind, that someone down the road will struggle with some concept you've recently conquered.

Submit a pull request here with [information about your post](https://github.com/turingschool/student_blogging).

We'll be promoting your blog posts every week.

#### Experiment with New Tools

* Consider taking [Vim][] for a spin. Not into Vim? What about TextMate, Emacs, Chocolat?
* Level up your git skills with Scott Chacon's [_Pro Git_](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
* Try out a visual git tool like [Github for Mac][ghfm], [GitX][gitx], [Tower][].
* Find a tool that allows you to use multiple clipboards ([Keyboard Maestro][km], [Flycut][fc]).
* Play with [RubyMine][rm]—a Ruby/Rails IDE.
