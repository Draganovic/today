## Everyone

### Warmup

This morning, please go on to Exercism and leave feedback on at least three
other submissions.

If you're not able to leave feedback yet, work on / complete
your current exercise.

### Posse Meeting Time (3:00-4:00)

#### State of Posses (3:00-3:05)
* We'll gather in **classroom** space for a few minutes to go over posse/mentor
feedback from Friday's survey.

#### Organizing (3:05-3:20)

* Research your new posse members
* Read the mentors email that Rachel sent out on Friday
* Email your mailing list with a description/summary of what you've been
doing so far, what's worked well and what hasn't
* Make pairing appointments with each other student in your posse
* Reach out to mentors about setting up pairing or code review sessions

#### Work Period (3:20-4:00)

During this time, do some programming with the other members of your posse. Some
ideas include:

* Last week everyone completed something. Show off the most difficult parts of
your work and get feedback. Look at the ugliest parts and do some refactoring.
* This week you're into new things. Talk about how you might design the
implementation. What are potential potholes along the way?
* Posses superseeded reading groups. It would be really amazing, though, to see
you select and read a text as a group.
