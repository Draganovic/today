This morning let's think about Linked Lists.

Go into your `problem_solving` repo from the homework and add our repo as a remote named `upstream`. Then pull the latest code:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:JumpstartLab/problem_solving.git
git pull upstream master
```

* Open `problems/exercise_2.markdown`
* Create a feature branch
* Create `solutions/yourlast_yourfirst/exercise_2.markdown`
* Build your solutions
* Push up to your fork and send a pull request
