## All

Last week, we arbitrarily decided Thursday is JavaScript day.

But, since you all have projects due tomorrow, we know you're not going to do tomorrow's warm up.

So, this week, we'll do it on a Wednesday. You should already have Node installed from last week.

Head over to [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/) and choose a workshop.

* Posse members from 1409 and 1410 should pair on `javascripting`.
* Posse members from 1406 and 1407 should pair on `learnyounode`.

Real pairing; not coexisting.
