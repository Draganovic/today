### Warm-Up (8:30 - 8:50)

Enough with the brain teasers, let's write some code.

**Meet in your posses to solve the following problem.**

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385

You square each number from one to ten and then you add them together.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025

You sum up each number and then you get the square of that sum.

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum. (Pro-tip: Write a method or function do figure this out on your behalf—don't do this by hand.)

* Can you write a solution in Ruby?
* What about JavaScript?
* What about Processing?
