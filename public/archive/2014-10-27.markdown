## All

Welcome back! We hope you enjoyed intermission week. Welcome 1410!

We'll do name tags for the week. Please grab one by the front door and include
both your first name and your cohort number.

### Posse Meeting Time (3:00 - 4:00)

Today, you'll meet in your new posses. Every posse will have a least one new member in it. So, you'll have to update some things and reintroduce yourselves.

#### Introduce yourself to your posse by answering the following questions

* Name and cohort?
* Where are you from originally?
* What brought you to Turing?
* What excites you most about the next six weeks at Turing?
* What do you think you dream job would be after graduating from Turing?
* What non-programming experience in your life do you think has best prepared you for being a developer?

#### Take care of administrative affairs

* Create/share a Google Calendar for your posse. You can use this calendar to request pairing sessions, set posse meetups, etc.
* Invite all posse members (students and mentors) to the calendar.
* Create and share a Google Doc to store contact info for your posse: name, email, Twitter, Github, phone, blog…
* Join the Slack channel for your posse

#### Find some common ground

* Your posse is named after a well known computer scientist. Who is this person and why are their contributions significant?
* What is a core value of your posse? Some examples: grit, perseverance. Why is this value important to being a developer?

#### Gather some intelligence

* Use Google, Github, Twitter, etc. to research your posse mentors.

#### Pass down some wisdom

* What should 1410 know about life at Turing? (e.g. time management, the extra set of bathrooms on the first floor and in the new space, the waffle truck)
* What should 1409 know about module two?
* What should 1407 know about module three?
* What are some habits you wish you formed early on? (e.g. technical blogging, warm-ups, reading)
