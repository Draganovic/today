## Retrospective

This morning we'll do retro just a bit differently.

### Project Group Retrospective 9:00-9:30

Put away computers and spend 30 minutes with your project group discussing:

* Where has the time gone? What's really done, kinda done, and not done at all?
* How are you sharing the workload? Is it efficient?
* How is the group communicating? How could it be improved?
* What are you learning? If group members are focused on one part of the project, do they want to rotate to another?
* When are you going to integrate the performance pieces? Do you understand how they work (so far)?

Please come back to the classroom by 9:35.

## Self-Study Time

When you're not in 1-on-1s, work on something **that is not your project** with at least one other person.

Do something that's hard and interesting.
