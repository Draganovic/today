## Warmup (8:30-9:00)

Write a program that:

* Generates the first 100 numbers in the [Fibonacci sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
* Prints them out one-by-one as it generates them
* Outputs whether they are or are not prime numbers

For example:

```
1. 0
2. 1
3. 1
4. 2 (prime)
5. 3 (prime)
6. 5 (prime)
7. 8
8. 13 (prime)
```

### Group Discussion

Then together we'll discuss:

* What not to do
* Top-down vs bottom-up approaches
* Breaking the problem down into components
* Building and validating small components
* Writing integration tests
