## SQL Fundamentals (8:30-11:30)

### How Databases Work

* Databases are organized in tables
* Few tables, many rows
* Store, search, calculate, and sort
* We primarily `SELECT` data from and `INSERT` data into those tables
* Scope operations using `WHERE`
* Connect tables together using `INNER JOIN`
* Sort records with `ORDER BY`
* We create relationships between data including *one-to-one*, *one-to-many*, and *many-to-many*
