## All

### Warm Up (8:30 - 8:50)

Alright. Let's assume that every letter is worth some amount of points based on it's order in the alphabet.

We've got eight people on staff these days:

* Jeff Casimir
* Jorge Téllez
* Rachel Warbelow
* Steve Kinney
* Raissa Shafer
* Josh Mejia
* Horace Williams
* Ben Orenstein

Assuming you multiply the value of each letter in a faculty members name, who has the greatest value?

`A` is worth 1 point. `Z` is worth 26. So far; so good.

**Example**: `hello` is `h * e * l * l * o`—which ends up being `8 * 5 * 12 * 12 * 15`. If you multiply them all together, that's 86400.

**TESTS OR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.**

### Acceptance Testing in Rails (1:00 - 2:30)

Are you ready for acceptance? If so, join Josh in Classroom C.

### Homework

Create a Fans controller and build the tests for that controller. They should cover the following actions:

* index
* show
* new
* create
* edit
* update
* delete

Remember that a good controller test checks for the type of response, the assignment of instance variable, the correct redirection and the display of flash messages if there are any. Use the example from the lesson outline if you are stuck.

Also using the Belieber app, finish implementing the `managing_fans_spec` feature using Poltergeist and Phantom.js. Be sure to set `js: true` on line 3 (`describe 'the company view', js: true, type: :feature do`). NOTE: You will need to checkout the `phantom` branch.
