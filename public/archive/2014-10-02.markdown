## Everyone

No warmup today since it's project delivery/work day.

## 1406

It seems like you need work time more than anything else, so we're not going to
schedule sessions today. If you need some feedback/help then create an issue on your
project and mention `@jcasimir`. You can work out of Market Street.

## 1407

This morning we want to check in on your Dinner Dash projects and make sure things
are on track. When you're not doing a check-in, keep cranking away.

Meet with Jeff near the 3D Printer at Blake.

* 9:00 - Cara Dennis & Rolando Navarrete & Sara Simon
* 10:00 - Kavita Sachdeva & Glen Egbert & Aaron Paul Wortham
* 11:00 - Jim Sutton & Jessica Goulding & Ian Andersen & Luke Aiken

#### Protocol

Your goal is to work with your partner to evaluate their project similar to the instructor evaluation.

* Use the the Evaluation Rubric in [the project assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/event_reporter.html)
* Run through the base stories
* Explore any extensions they completed
* Work through the rubric and add your rubric scores to the submissions page
* If time allows, dig into their implementation to fix up bugs, explore interesting code, etc

You should spend about an hour on each partner's project. Please make use of the full time available this morning.
