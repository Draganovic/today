### One on Ones, Student-Led Sessions, and Read/Write/Listen (1:00 - 3:00)

Use this time for focused self-study. Explore a new language. Try out
an interesting tool or technology. Spend some time honing or configuring
one of your tools.

If you're not participating in an organized session, spend some time
reading an article or blog post, or watching/listening to a conference
talk.

Here are a few recommendations to check out:

* [NAND2Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/). Take some time to dig into
  the nand2tetris project that Yong showed us on Thursday.
* [Real Software Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP9AIUT9nos) by Glenn Vanderburg.
  Glenn digs in to the topic of what "Engineering" means and how we can
  benefit from applying these ideas to Software Projects.
* [Simplicity Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0) by
  Rich Hickey. This Railsconf keynote from a few years ago digs into the
  inherent problem of complexity in software systems. Rich discusses
  some ways we consistently get things wrong, and offers some ideas of
  how to do better.
* [Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html)
  by Steve Yegge. Yegge produces some of the most prescient technical writing
  out there, and this analysis of some common pitfalls in
  Object-Oriented programming is no exception.
* [The Birth and Death of Javascript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript)
  by Gary Bernhardt. This talk examines javascript from the perspective
  of its impact on web development and where things might go in a
  hypothetical future.
* [Try some React](http://axiacore.com/blog/beginners-introduction-reactjs). Everyone needs to
  keep up with the latest JS framework hotness. React is actually a
  pretty interesting one. Spend some time exploring React. Consider how
  it is similar to or different from other Javascript tools you've used
  before.
* [Try Some Clojure](http://www.braveclojure.com/) Clojure is a dialect
  of lisp written for the JVM. It emphasizes a functional approach to
  programming using immutable data. Plus you'll get to try some emacs
  along the way!
* [A Nerd in a Cave](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/a-nerd-in-a-cave/) Relevant to
  the topics Chris discussed this morning.

Respect the Friday.

### Electives (3:00 - 4:00)

#### GitCoins and Ruby Concurrency for Fun and Profit

Join Horace in Classroom B to talk about the Dungeon's favorite crypto-currency,
the __GitCoin__ ([site](http://git-coin.turingapps.io/gitcoins) / [repo](https://github.com/worace/git-coin)).
We'll learn:

* What is a GitCoin?
* How can I acquire GitCoins?
* How can I use multiple threads to acquire lots of GitCoins?
* How can I exchange my GitCoins for Posse Cup Points?

You will want to use JRuby for this exercise, so if you have not already, make
sure you have [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) and [JRuby](https://rvm.io/interpreters/jruby) installed. This session will require some knowledge of
making HTTP requests so it may not be suited for module 1 students.

#### Something Excellent with Josh Cheek

Idk, just show up and we'll explore whatever :P Maybe the Object Model.
Maybe we'll make up some games and play them!
Maybe explore how to start a project.
Maybe pry. Maybe refactoring. Maybe command our browsers by writing HTTP responses by hand!
Anything is possible, really :)

#### SmallTalk with Mike Dao -- Classroom A

Learn about the programming language that Ruby draws a lot of it's inspiration from. Get better at Object Oriented Programming.

#### Side Hustles: Sports Edition with Josh Mejia

Interested in sports? and coding? Join Josh to talk about and hack
on sports related side projects.
