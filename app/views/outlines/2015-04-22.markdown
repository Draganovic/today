### Authorization (10:30 - 12:00)

Stick around to add admin functionality to your applications. Find the outline [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/authorization.markdown). 

### Authorization Worktime (1:00 - 4:00)

Add authorization in your My Jams project so that only an admin can create tags. 

* Admin should be able to CRUD tags.
* Default users should NOT be able to add new tags, but they should be able to tag their songs (modify your song creation form). 
* Songs should be automatically associated with the logged in user when they are created. 
* Change `resources :users` to be a singular resource route (ie - when a user logs in and sees their dashboard, the route should be `localhost:3000/user`. 
* Extension: admin should be able to CRUD images and users should be able to select an image
