Today in History: Remember that last scene in Braveheart, where Robert the Bruce lead the Scots
to victory against the English? That happened today in 1314.

It's also Lionel Messi's birthday if that matters to anyone.

### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

Here's a themed puzzle for you:

Imagine you run a soccer league and you need to create a schedule. Each team
plays only one game per week on Saturday.

#### Easy

Your league has eight teams. Generate (to the screen or to a file), a schedule that has each team play each other team exactly once.

#### Medium

Your league has two divisions of eight teams. Each team should play the other
teams in their division twice and the teams in the other division just once.

#### Hard

Your league has four divisions of eight teams. Each team should play each team
in their division twice and any two teams from each other division.
