## All

### WarmUp (8:30 - 9:00)

Let's model a [Phoenix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology)).

* Create a `phoenix_test.rb` file
* Add a few tests with behavior you'd expect from a magical bird of fire.
* Create the implementation
* Add more tests/implementation until time is up.

Post your solution in #warmup-answers with your full posse name to receive 15 points. The most interesting implementation
receives an extra 15 bonus points. Cut-off is 9:00 am.
