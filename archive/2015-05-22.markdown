### Electives (2:00 - 4:00)

#### TO BE ANNOUNCED

#### GitCoins and Ruby Concurrency for Fun and Profit

Join Horace in Classroom B to talk about the Dungeon's favorite crypto-currency,
the __GitCoin__ ([site](http://git-coin.turingapps.io/gitcoins) / [repo](https://github.com/worace/git-coin)).
We'll learn:

* What is a GitCoin?
* How can I acquire GitCoins?
* How can I use multiple threads to acquire lots of GitCoins?
* How can I exchange my GitCoins for Posse Cup Points?

You will want to use JRuby for this exercise, so if you have not already, make
sure you have [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) and [JRuby](https://rvm.io/interpreters/jruby) installed. This session will require some knowledge of
making HTTP requests so it may not be suited for module 1 students.

#### Passion Projects - Theme: Sportsball

Join Josh to hack on sports related side projects.

#### Quality Time with Jason Noble
We have the privilege of having the current leader in the Mentor Cup join us this afternoon. Jason will be hanging out in Classroom A, and will be doing a session on pairing and TDD. 1505 is highly encouraged to attend this.

#### Side Hustles with Not Steve

Mike is filling in for Steve

Working on an awesome side project and need some accountability? Want to work on a side project, but need some inspiration? Interested in open source, but not sure where to start?
