### Authentication (9:00 - 12:00)

Don't let creepers into your application. Learn how to authenticate your users with Rachel in Classroom C. You'll need [this repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/authentication) and you might want [these slides](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/k8jsy5i9wgwk52x/AADpCVwnRuZThsmTVfFU2i3na?dl=0).

### Worktime: Authentication (1:00 - 4:00)

Add users and authentication to your My Jams app:

* User should be able to create accounts with a unique username
* User should be able to log into their account
* User should be able to log out of their account
* Extension: Associate songs with users. When a user logs in, they should see only their songs when they navigate to `/songs`. When they create a song through the web interface, that song should be associated with the user. 

Remember to use the app we created in this morning's lesson and the slides (linked above) for reference.
