## All

### Posse Meeting Time (8:30 - 9:00)

Meet with you posses:

* Schedule student-to-student pairing/mentoring sessions
* Update mentors with the projects you're currently working on
* Schedule pairing sessions with mentors

### Cross-Cohort Pairing (2:30 - 4:00)

It's time to sharped our skills. We'll be working with colleagues from assorted cohorts.
Everyone needs to meet in the big workspace at 2:30.

Today we're going to run two 40-minute sessions experimenting with the [Game of
Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). You should read that
Wikipedia page beforehand. It's very unlikely that you'll succeed in implementing
the game, the point is to practice your programming and pairing. Consider focusing
on the "Still Lifes" and "Oscillators" demonstrated in the article.

Please work with the following randomly-generated pairings. You should use one
computer and an external keyboard. If your pair is MIA or you're not listed, come
up to the front of the room.

#### Session 1 - Top-Down

In this first session, approach the problem "top-down" starting with a board
and working towards cells.
