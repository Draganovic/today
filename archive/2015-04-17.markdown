Yes, you read it right. Let's understand all those jokes that cool Ruby kids tell by learning PHP, the language from hell. We'll work through the [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/php) PHP track. (Don't tell your mom.)

#### Side Hustles with Steve

Working on an awesome side project and need some accountability? Want to work on a side project, but need some inspiration? Interested in open source, but not sure where to start?

Meet with Steve in the Big Workspace.

#### Team Draper

Meet with Jeff & Mike Dao at the big table by the instructor desks.

#### Omg, students, lets go exploring!

Ask all the questions, everything you want to know.
We'll meander wherever curiousity has us go.
Let intrigue be our guide, fascination our divining rod,
we'll question all the rules and challenge all the gods.
Is it methodology? Is it code?
Is it C? Is it Node?
We'll devise experiments, the laboratory is our shell,
dabbling in the source code, our doubt will be dispelled.
Burn all the maps, dash the compass on the rocks,
This description was written during your lightning talks :P
