Meet with Mike in Classroom C to recap [CSVs](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/file_io_and_csvs.markdown)
and to see some of the cool things can do with them.

### EventManager (10:00 - 2:00)

Let's put your CSV knowledge into practice. You have some time to dive into the [EventManager Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html).

Some things to keep in mind:

* You won't finish the tutorial, that's ok
* This work time is about exposure and learning, not mastery and perfect code
* Go slow enough that you understand / think critically about all your code
* Don't write tests. This is exposure, not high quality code. You'll do plenty of testing in SalesEngine.
* Feel free to play and dive deeper if something catches your eye

Mike will hang out in the workspace for your questions.
