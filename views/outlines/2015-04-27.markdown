### SE1 - Business Logic & Encapsulation (1:00 - 2:30)

If you've been working on SalesEngine for a week, then this week we're calling you "SE1". Join Horace in Classroom A
to refine your approach to Business Logic / Intelligence.

### SE2 - Introducing SalesEngine (1:00 - 2:30)

If you've just finished Chisel then this week you're known as the "SE2" group. Join Josh Cheek in Classroom C to [start
diving into the project](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/sales_engine.html).

Your pairs are:

* Ricky & Rob
* Michael & Dave
* Margarett & Eugene
* Lev & Vanessa

By the way, if you didn't pass [Chisel](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/chisel.html) then that still needs
to happen, too. As the price for the extra time you *also*
need to complete the Images extension in addition to cleaning up whatever your issues were. You must have everything
completed and evaluated by 3pm on Tuesday, 5/12.

Here are the notes from when we went through it together: [https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/8134d66f586ba83a6dbc](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/8134d66f586ba83a6dbc).
